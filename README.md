**Hey there!** 👋

I’m Fransisco, a CS student at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg (HAW).

I love learning by building small tools and experiments that can be useful.

Right now I’m mostly working with Java and Python and learning web dev and backend. 

I use GitHub as my playground to try out new concepts.
